                <li>Garlic - 2-4 cloves (to taste)</li>
                <li>Vegetable oil for frying - 2 tablespoons</li>
                <li>Ground paprika - 2 tsp.</li>
                <li>Cayenne pepper - 1 pinch (to taste)</li>
                <li>Dried granulated garlic - 1 tsp.</li>
                <li>Seasoning for chicken - 2 tsp.</li>
                <li>Ground black pepper - to taste</li>
                <li>Salt - to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <ol>
                <li>Salt the chicken well. Season with dried garlic, ground paprika, chicken seasoning, cayenne pepper and ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Add vegetable oil and mix.</li>
                <li>Let the chicken fillet marinate for 15 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Let's start preparing the sauce. Mix sour cream and mayonnaise.</li>
                <li>Finely chop the greens and add to the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add garlic cloves, peeled and pressed through a press.</li>
                <li>Mix and leave the sauce to infuse.</li>
                <li>Now let's start cutting vegetables. Chop the cabbage quite finely.</li>
                <li>Cut the pickled cucumbers (you can use salted or fresh) into slices (thin slices).</li>
                <li>Grate the cheese on a fine grater.</li>
                <li>Let's heat up the grill pan. Pour in and distribute one tablespoon of vegetable oil evenly.</li>
                <li>Place the marinated chicken in the pan.</li>
                <li>We will fry the chicken fillet pieces until golden brown, about 7-8 minutes on each side.</li>
                <li>While the chicken is roasting, let's start chopping the tomatoes. We cut the tomatoes last, as they release juice quickly.</li>
                <li>Place the finished chicken pieces on foil and wrap as desired.</li>
                <li>Leave aside for 5 minutes to make the fried fillet juicier.</li>
                <li>Then cut the chicken into smaller pieces.</li>
                <li>Let's unroll the lavash sheet. Lubricate the surface of the pita bread with half the sauce according to the size of the future shawarma, stepping back from the edge to a width slightly larger than the size of the shawarma, in order to then cover the filling with it</li>
                <li>Divide all the ingredients in half and place them on pita bread, greased with sauce, in layers.
                    The first layer is always chicken meat.
                    The second one is cabbage.
                    The third one is cucumbers.
                    Fourth - tomatoes.
                    Fifth - Korean carrot.
                    The sixth layer is cheese. Donâ€™t feel sorry for him, it will taste better this way.</li>
                <li>And wrap the filling in pita bread in the form of a roll.
                    We form the second shawarma, repeating the same steps.</li>
                <li>Heat the grill pan (wash it first or wipe it thoroughly with a paper towel after frying the chicken. Place the shawarma on the pan.</li>
                <li>Fry the shawarma on both sides. As soon as everything inside is thoroughly warmed up and the pita bread becomes rosy and crispy, put the finished homemade shawarma on a plate and serve.</li>
                <li>Bon appetit!</li>
            </ol>
