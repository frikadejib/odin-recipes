        <h1>Salad "Olivier"</h1>

        <h2>Do you like classic Olivier salad with sausage? If yes, then you probably know that the taste of this dish directly depends on the quality of the meat component. Some people put only doctor’s in such Olivier, others put “Russian” with small fat, and some even use language. It seems to us that the main thing is that the sausage is fresh and tasty, regardless of its type. Of course, many will note that this salad has nothing in common with real Olivier, which was once prepared with hazel grouse, crayfish tails and caviar. But what can you do if a simplified recipe has existed for several decades and therefore deserves the title “classic”. And, let’s be honest, once a year (most often, closer to the end), we experience a lack of Olivier in the body. What to do? Go to the kitchen, boil potatoes, eggs and carrots, then chop them and other ingredients and, finally, combine them with mayonnaise in the proverbial bowl, the contents of which should be enough for several holiday days.</h2>

            <li>Let's prepare all the ingredients for the classic Olivier salad. Wash the potatoes thoroughly with water using a brush, then put them in a saucepan and fill with water. Bring to a boil and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the water from the root vegetables. Let them cool completely. If possible, put it in the refrigerator for 2 hours. After this, peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes with a side of 1 cm.</li>
            <li>At the same time as the potatoes, cook the carrots. It should also be washed, filled with water and cooked for about 30 minutes. Let the carrots cool thoroughly, peel and cut into cubes with a side of 1 cm.</li>
            <li>Wash the eggs for Olivier, place them in a saucepan and fill with water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Cool under running water, then peel and cut into cubes.</li>
            <li>Cut the boiled sausage for Olivier into small cubes. Transfer to a large bowl, in which we will then combine and mix the salad ingredients.</li>
            <li>We take the pickles out of the jar. We cut off the ends. Cut the cucumbers into small cubes. Pour into a large bowl with the previously chopped sausage. Don't mix!</li>        
            <li>Place the canned peas in a fine sieve to drain the liquid. Transfer to a small container or directly into a bowl with the sausage and pickles.</li>  
            <li>Peel and finely chop the onion for Olivier. To get rid of the pungent taste and smell, you can place the onion in a bowl and add lemon juice or apple cider vinegar. Leave for 5 minutes. Drain off the lemon juice or apple cider vinegar.</li>  
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a large bowl with sausage and pickles. Add mayonnaise and mix. Taste Olivier, add salt and pepper to taste. Mix again and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
